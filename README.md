## Motivation

In recent times, we've seen numerous instances where journalists are silenced or news is distorted. This motivated us to create Just News—a platform where truth prevails. We believe in the power of accurate information and want to provide a space where everyone can share real news without fear of repercussions.

## Features

- *📝 Anonymous News Sharing:* Users can share news stories anonymously, ensuring their safety.
- *🔍 Evidence Verification:* Every story is verified for authenticity with required evidence before being published.
- *📱 User-Friendly Interface:* Built with Flutter for a seamless user experience.
- *🔒 Secure Data:* Utilizes Firebase to ensure the security and privacy of user data.
- *🛠 Admin Panel:* Allows admins to verify news and manage submissions.

## Future Scope

- *🤖 AI/ML Integration:* Using AI and ML algorithms for automated news verification to ensure authenticity and detect fake news.
- *📍 Location Tracking:* Tracking the location from where news and videos are submitted, while hiding the user's identity.

## Technologies Used

- *Flutter:* For building the app's cross-platform user interface.
- *Firebase:* For backend services including authentication, real-time database, and storage solutions.
- *Dart:* The programming language used with Flutter.

## How It Works

1. *User Registration:* Users sign up using their email or anonymously.
2. *Submitting News:* Users can submit news stories along with supporting evidence (images, documents, etc.).
3. *Verification Process:* Admins verify the authenticity of the news by reviewing the evidence.
4. *Publishing:* Once verified, the news story is published on the platform for all users to read.
